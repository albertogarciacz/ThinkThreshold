# ThinkThreshold
A windows 10 script to set the Lenovo battery threshold. Meant to be run often with Task Scheduler for laptops that "forget" the threshold settings. Currently Lenovo Settings appears to have been patched, and this error no longer occurs on my test laptop, so this script may no longer be needed or function.

SEE README- SCRIPT WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT MANUAL CONFIGURATION (Every battery has a unique serial number, and you must put yours into the script)
